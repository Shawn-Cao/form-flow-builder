# form-builder
Trying to generalize something out of a few projects using dynamic forms

1. I need something like the famous react-jsonschema-form. But with more support for view changes.
2. I don't feel complying with JSON-schema makes view transition harder, but something similar is still needed, prob lighter.
3. More on the schema language, I should prob make it nested, with top level defining the form data structure.
