# form-builder
Trying to generalize something out of a few projects using dynamic forms

1. I need something like the famous react-jsonschema-form. But with more support for view changes.
2. I feel complying with JSON-schema makes view transition harder, but something similar is still needed, prob lighter.
3. More on the schema language, I should prob make it nested, with top level defining the form data structure.
4. The base features should be easy to use and learn. Must support tree shaking with good examples
